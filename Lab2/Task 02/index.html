            <p class="before-text">PWA is an advanced website technology used by reputable organizations. It offers smooth working, less loading time, and a linear user experience. The concept isn’t all that new and has been around for quite some time. It is impacting the web development trends in 2022 as it has made it to this list. PWAs are popular for their accessibility and reliability, as they can be accessed through any device from anywhere. You don’t have to download a separate mobile app to access it. For example, if you have come across the Uber application, it uses Progressive web app development to grant a linear and smooth experience. It allows users offline access with all the features of the native mobile app and is leading the web app development in 2022.</p>
